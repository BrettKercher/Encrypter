This is an encryption/decryption program that utilizes the RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the contents of plaintext.txt. 

To use Encrypt, run "java Encrypt plaintext.txt key.txt" and it will give an output file called encrypted.
You can then run Decrypt with "java Decrypt encrypted key.txt" and it will output a file called decrypted, which contains the same text as plaintext.
